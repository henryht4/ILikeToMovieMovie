like-predicate.txt

We use LIKE in SearchManager.java in the query we have used prepared statements
to create the queries with whichever combination the users enters for the 
search page. We add the '%' character before and after every piece of information
so we can find if a title or name contains any part of the parameter. If a user
does not enter any info for that parameter we insert '%%' which will then not
use that parameter to search for titles.
